# Social Media Analytics Project

**Problem Statement:**

In the realm of online education, NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) hosts a plethora of educational lectures on YouTube covering a wide array of topics. However, navigating through this vast repository of videos to identify relevant content can be daunting. In order to enhance accessibility and usability, there arises a need for a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution.

The objective of this project is to develop an advanced Topic Modelling system tailored specifically for NPTEL YouTube lectures. Leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques, this system aims to automatically categorize and organize lecture content into coherent topics, thus facilitating easier search, navigation, and recommendation for learners.

Key components of the problem statement include:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gathering NPTEL lecture transcripts from YouTube, and preprocessing the text data to ensure quality and consistency.

2. **Topic Modelling Algorithm:** Implementing NLP algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), or advanced deep learning models to extract latent topics from lecture transcripts.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:** Defining appropriate metrics to assess the effectiveness of the topic modeling system in terms of coherence, relevance, and coverage of topics.

4. **Integration and Deployment:** Developing a user-friendly interface for learners to interact with the topic modeling system, and deploying it for real-world usage on the NPTEL platform.

5. **Scalability and Maintenance:** Designing the system with scalability in mind to handle a growing volume of lectures over time, and establishing procedures for periodic maintenance and updates.

By addressing these components, the proposed solution aims to empower learners with a more efficient and intuitive means of exploring the vast knowledge repository offered by NPTEL, thereby enhancing the overall learning experience.
