# Social Media Analytics Project

**Problem Statement:**

NPTEL, a prominent platform for educational lectures on YouTube, hosts a vast collection of diverse content. However, navigating through this extensive repository to find relevant lectures can be challenging. To address this issue, there is a pressing need to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance accessibility and utility.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated Topic Modelling system tailored specifically for NPTEL YouTube lectures. Through the application of advanced NLP algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), the system aims to automatically categorize lecture transcripts into coherent topics. This process will enable learners to efficiently search, navigate, and discover content aligned with their interests and learning objectives.

Furthermore, the extracted topic structures can serve as the foundation for constructing an ontology graph. By establishing semantic relationships between topics, this graph can provide a structured representation of knowledge, facilitating deeper insights into the interconnections and dependencies within the NPTEL lecture content. Such an ontology graph not only enhances the organization and accessibility of lectures but also enables more sophisticated functionalities, such as intelligent recommendation systems and personalized learning pathways.

Through the integration of cutting-edge NLP methodologies and the creation of an ontology graph, this project aims to revolutionize the way learners engage with NPTEL YouTube lectures. By providing a more intuitive and efficient means of exploring the vast educational resources available, this initiative seeks to empower learners and enrich their educational journey.
